# Genome analysis of microalgae

## Introduction

This repository contains the code, data, and results used to evaluate the genome sequences of microalgae species.

## Data

The data used in this study is available in the data directory. The data is organized as follows:

- `genomes': contains the genome sequences of the microalgae species in FASTA and GFF format.

## Code

- 'orthofinder.py': script to read and process the results from OrthoFinder. 
- 'results_analysis': script to analyze the results from BUSCO and InterProScan.
- 'run_busco.py': script to run BUSCO on the genome sequences.
- 'run_interproscan.py': script to run InterProScan on the genome sequences.

## Results

The results of this study are available in the results directory. The results are organized as follows:

- 'upset_plot_all.pdf': Upset plot showing the results from OrthoFinder.

Busco and InterProScan results are available upon request due to the large size of the files.
